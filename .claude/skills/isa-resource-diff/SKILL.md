  Detect per-kernel GPU resource regressions (VGPR, SGPR, register spills, scratch,
  static LDS) by diffing the final ISA before and after a change, using
  scripts/isa_resource_table.py. Compile-only: needs no GPU and no profiler run, so
  it works on any target the compiler supports and runs in seconds. Use when asked
  whether a change increased register pressure, caused spilling, or hurt occupancy,
  when reviewing a kernel change for resource impact, or as a fast pre-check before
  spending a profiling run.

# ISA Resource Diff

Compare per-kernel register, spill, scratch, and LDS usage between two builds to
catch resource regressions that functional tests do not surface.

## Pick the right skill first

| Question | Skill |
|---|---|
| Did my change increase registers / cause spills / grow LDS? | **this skill** (compile-only, seconds, no GPU) |
| *Why* is this kernel slow — which instructions stall, and on what? | `/kernel-trace-analysis` (needs a GPU run + rocprofv3 ATT trace) |
| Which commit made it slow? | `/bisect-perf-regression` (needs a runnable benchmark) |
| How do I collect a trace at all? | `/capture-kernel-trace` |

This skill measures **resources, not time**. A clean result here does not mean
performance is unchanged — it means register/LDS/spill pressure is unchanged.
A regression here is a strong, cheap signal that is usually worth acting on
before profiling, because spilling and occupancy cliffs dominate most kernel
slowdowns. See §7 of `docs/kernel_tuning_guide.md` for what to do about one.

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `<TEST-OR-COMMAND>` | No | What to run to produce dumps. Defaults to asking the user. Example: `pytest tests/kernels/test_softmax.py -q` |
| `--arch <gfx>` | No | Target for compile-only runs, e.g. `gfx950`. Omit to use local hardware |

If the user already has two dump directories or two JSON snapshots, skip to Step 3.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Capture the "before" side

Check out or stash to the baseline state first, then:

```bash
FLYDSL_DUMP_IR=1 FLYDSL_DUMP_DIR=/tmp/isa-before FLYDSL_RUNTIME_ENABLE_CACHE=0 \
    python3 -m pytest tests/kernels/test_softmax.py -q
```

`FLYDSL_RUNTIME_ENABLE_CACHE=0` is **required, not optional** — see Pitfalls.

For a target without local hardware, add `ARCH=<gfx> COMPILE_ONLY=1`:

```bash
ARCH=gfx950 COMPILE_ONLY=1 \
FLYDSL_DUMP_IR=1 FLYDSL_DUMP_DIR=/tmp/isa-before FLYDSL_RUNTIME_ENABLE_CACHE=0 \
    python3 -m pytest tests/kernels/test_softmax.py -q
```

### Step 2 — Capture the "after" side

Apply the change, then rerun **the identical command** into a *fresh* directory
(`/tmp/isa-after`). Same test, same parameters, same arch, same cache setting.

### Step 3 — Diff

```bash
python3 scripts/isa_resource_table.py diff /tmp/isa-before /tmp/isa-after
```

The tool requires **Python 3.10+**. If `python3` is older it exits 2 with a clear
message; use `python3.10 scripts/isa_resource_table.py …` instead.

Both sides may independently be a dump directory or a `.json` snapshot, so a
baseline can be captured once and reused:

```bash
python3 scripts/isa_resource_table.py summarize /tmp/isa-before --json baseline.json
python3 scripts/isa_resource_table.py diff baseline.json /tmp/isa-after
```

## Reading the output

```
* = regression trigger; other columns are informational.
  vgpr = total (arch+acc, LLVM's occupancy number); arch_vgpr/agpr are its split -- do not add them.
kernel                               *vgpr     arch_vgpr  agpr ... *lds_static_bytes lds_read ...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gemm::d128_fmha_fwd_kernel_0 942->960(+18) 942->960(+18)     0 ... 212992->229376(+16384)      12

compared 1 of 1 kernels; 0 unchanged; 1 changed; worsened: 2; improved: 0
RESULT: REGRESSION
```

Only changed and problematic kernels are printed. The last two stdout lines are
always a count line and a `RESULT:` verdict that matches the exit code exactly.

**Columns marked `*` are regression triggers**; the rest are context.

| Column | Trigger | Read from | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `vgpr` | yes | `.vgpr_count` metadata | Total VGPRs, arch + accumulator — LLVM's own occupancy number |
| `arch_vgpr` | no | `.set` symbol `num_vgpr` | The arch half of that total |
| `agpr` | no | `.set` symbol `num_agpr` | The accumulator half of that total |
| `sgpr` | yes | `.sgpr_count` metadata | SGPRs including the fixed extras (VCC, XNACK, FLAT_SCRATCH) |
| `numbered_sgpr` | no | `.set` symbol `numbered_sgpr` | SGPRs without those extras; tells a real increase from VCC becoming live |
| `vgpr_spill` | yes | `.vgpr_spill_count` metadata | VGPRs the allocator spilled |
| `sgpr_spill` | yes | `.sgpr_spill_count` metadata | SGPRs the allocator spilled |
| `scratch_bytes` | yes | `.private_segment_fixed_size` metadata | Private segment per work-item; exact on every target |
| `lds_static_bytes` | yes | `.group_segment_fixed_size` metadata | Statically allocated LDS per work-group |
| `lds_read` / `lds_write` | no | instruction count | `ds_read`/`ds_load` and `ds_write`/`ds_store` sites |
| `scratch_store` / `scratch_load` | no | instruction count | `scratch_*` sites; `n/a` where spilling goes through `buffer_*` |
| `matrix_ops` | no | instruction count | MFMA / WMMA sites |

Three things are easy to misread:

- **Do not add `arch_vgpr` and `agpr` to `vgpr`.** `vgpr` is already the total
  (arch + accumulator) and is the only VGPR-family trigger. The other two are its
  split, shown so you can tell *which half* moved. Moving accumulators into AGPRs
  — which the tuning guide recommends — deliberately does not count as a regression.
- **`n/a` is not `0`.** It means the quantity does not exist on this target, e.g.
  `scratch_store`/`scratch_load` on a target that spills through `buffer_*`. Use
  `scratch_bytes`, which is exact everywhere.
- **`?` means unparsed** — the tool could not read something it reports. Any `?`
  forces exit 2. Never treat it as unchanged.

### Exit codes

| Code | stdout | Meaning | What an agent should do |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0` | `RESULT: OK` | Everything comparable, no trigger increased | Proceed |
| `1` | `RESULT: REGRESSION` | Everything comparable, a trigger increased | Investigate — this is a real finding |
| `2` | `RESULT: NOT TRUSTWORTHY` | The tool cannot answer | **Fix the inputs and rerun. Do not report "no regression"** |

Exit `1` is a claim about the code under test; exit `2` is a claim about the
tool's own confidence. Everything that would leave the answer partial reports `2`
and never `1`: a crash, an empty dump directory, a dump file that does not parse
or does not decode, a metadata entry with no kernel identity or a duplicated one,
a negative resource count, a kernel present on only one side, and a target that
differs — or that the tool cannot name — on either side.

For scripting, `-q/--quiet` prints only the verdict line, and `--json PATH`
writes the full comparison as machine-readable JSON:

```bash
python3 scripts/isa_resource_table.py diff /tmp/isa-before /tmp/isa-after -q --json report.json
case $? in
  0) echo "no resource regression" ;;
  1) echo "REGRESSION — see report.json" ;;
  *) echo "inconclusive — inputs are bad, do not claim a clean result" ;;
esac
```

## Acting on a regression

Map the column that moved to a cause, then follow `docs/kernel_tuning_guide.md`:

| Column increased | Usual cause |
|---|---|
| `vgpr` | More live values; larger tiles or deeper pipelining/unrolling |
| `vgpr_spill` / `sgpr_spill` / `scratch_bytes` | Register pressure crossed the budget — normally the most damaging of these signals |
| `lds_static_bytes` | Bigger shared tiles or added double buffering; may cross an occupancy step |
| `sgpr` alone, by 2, with `numbered_sgpr` flat | Usually just VCC becoming live — rarely meaningful |

If a resource regression is confirmed but the kernel is not actually slower,
say so rather than "fixing" it: these are proxies for occupancy, not timings.
Confirm with `/kernel-trace-analysis` before reworking a kernel.

## Pitfalls

These silently produce a *confident wrong answer* if ignored:

- **Dump directories are keyed by kernel name only, with no specialization key.**
  Every JIT specialization of one kernel writes to the same directory and
  overwrites the previous one, so a parametrized test leaves only its last
  variant. Diff one shape at a time when the answer must be exact.
- **A cache hit produces no dump at all.** Hence `FLYDSL_RUNTIME_ENABLE_CACHE=0`
  on both sides. Without it a kernel can silently vanish from one side, which
  the tool reports as `ONLY IN BEFORE` and exit 2.
- **`lds_static_bytes` is static LDS only.** A kernel using
  `SharedAllocator(static=False)` reports `0` no matter how much LDS it takes at
  dispatch; the tool prints a `dynamic LDS in use` note for it. LDS regressions
  in those kernels are invisible here.
- **The stage number in `NN_final_isa.s` varies between runs.** Nothing cleans the
  dump directory, so reusing one can leave two files side by side. The tool uses
  the highest-numbered one and warns; prefer a fresh directory per run.
- **Diffs across targets are refused** (exit 2). Register files and LDS banking
  differ between architectures, and `xnack`/`sramecc` change code generation
  within one, so both sides must report the same processor *and* the same target
  features. A target the tool cannot name is refused for the same reason. The
  triple's environment field is normalized, so `amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx942` and
  `amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-unknown-gfx942` are the same target.
- **Warnings on stderr never change the exit code.** They describe the input tree
  and are worth reading before trusting a clean result.

## Verifying the tool itself

`tests/unit/test_isa_resource_table.py` is backend-agnostic and needs no build:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_isa_resource_table.py -q
```

It generates its ISA input in `make_isa()` rather than checking dumps in, so the
test file states exactly which parts of LLVM's output the parser relies on. The
shapes cover both sides of each axis that has already broken it once: whether the
target emits `.agpr_count`, which LDS mnemonic spelling it uses, and whether the
target ID spells the triple's environment as empty or as `unknown`. The rest of
the file pins the fail-closed verdicts: a mismatched processor, a mismatched
feature set, an unnameable target, an unreadable or undecodable dump file, a
kernel entry with no identity or a duplicated one, and a negative count all have
to reach exit 2.

If the tool reports `?` on a dump that looks healthy, LLVM's assembly format has
probably drifted — update `make_isa()` to match the new shape rather than
loosening the parser, since the failure is deliberately loud.
